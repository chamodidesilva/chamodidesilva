# 👋 Hi there, I'm Chamodi

I’m someone who is actively growing in the DevOps space. I’m drawn to DevOps because I enjoy automating and improving things and building systems that run smoothly in the background. I like creating workflows that remove friction and keep things working just right. I’m currently looking for career opportunities in DevOps where I can transform this passion into a profession.
